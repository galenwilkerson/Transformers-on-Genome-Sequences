# Transformers on Genome Sequences

<img src="./dnabert_umap.png" width="450" height="400">

This repository demonstrates the use of transformers, including pre-trained BERT and DNABERT, to analyze and visualize genome sequences. The project downloads mitochondrial DNA sequences from various organisms, preprocesses them, and uses these transformer models to generate embeddings. These embeddings are then visualized using UMAP and clustered to observe the relationships between sequences from different organisms.

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into the heterogeneity and relationships between genome sequences from different organisms. By leveraging transformer models like pre-trained BERT and DNABERT, we can generate meaningful embeddings that capture the underlying structure of the sequences. The embeddings are visualized using UMAP and clustered to reveal patterns and relationships.

## Intuitive Description of Transformers Applied to DNA Sequences

Transformers have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to understand and generate human language with unprecedented accuracy. At their core, transformers are designed to capture the contextual relationships between words in a sentence, allowing them to understand meaning in a nuanced way. When applied to DNA sequences, transformers operate on a similar principle, but instead of words and sentences, they deal with the nucleotides (A, T, C, G) that make up genetic sequences.

### Analogies to Transformers Used for Text

1. **Vocabulary**:
   In text processing, transformers use a vocabulary of words. For DNA sequences, the "vocabulary" consists of the four nucleotides: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).

2. **Sentences and Sequences**:
   A sentence in NLP can be compared to a DNA sequence in genomics. Just as a sentence is a string of words, a DNA sequence is a string of nucleotides. Transformers process these sequences to understand their structure and function.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:
   Transformers for text understand the meaning of a word based on its context within a sentence. Similarly, transformers for DNA sequences capture the relationship between nucleotides within a genetic sequence, helping to reveal patterns and functions that are not apparent when looking at individual nucleotides in isolation.

4. **Embeddings**:
   In NLP, words are converted into embeddingsâ€”numeric representations that capture their meaning. For DNA, nucleotides or k-mers (short sequences of nucleotides) are converted into embeddings that capture their biological significance. These embeddings are used to analyze and compare sequences more effectively.

5. **Attention Mechanism**:
   The attention mechanism in transformers allows the model to focus on relevant parts of a sentence when making predictions. In the context of DNA, the attention mechanism helps the model to focus on important regions of the sequence that may be crucial for understanding genetic functions or identifying mutations.

By leveraging these similarities, transformers can be effectively applied to genomic data, providing powerful tools for biological research and advancing our understanding of genetics.
